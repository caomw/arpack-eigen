# ARPACK-Eigen

> A redesign of the [ARPACK](http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/)
software for large scale eigenvalue problems, built on top of
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), an open source C++ linear algebra library.

**ARPACK-Eigen** is a header-only library implemented using the modern C++
language, whose only dependency, **Eigen**, is also a header-only library.
Hence **ARPACK-Eigen** is easy to be embedded in C++ projects that require
solving large scale eigenvalue problems.
